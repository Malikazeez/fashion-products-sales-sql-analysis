# 👗 Fashion Products Sales – SQL Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project uses SQL to analyze fashion product data across multiple brands with the aim of understanding product pricing, consumer preferences, and brand-level performance.

It was completed as an early SQL analytics project, focusing on exploratory data analysis and structured querying to extract insights from retail product data.

## 🎯 Objective
The objective of this analysis is to explore fashion product performance by examining:
- Average pricing across products and brands
- Consumer preferences based on ratings and purchase frequency
- Product-level and brand-level sales patterns
- Variations in consumer preference by color, size, and demographic segment

## 🔧 Tools Used
- **SQL** – Data querying and analysis

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains fashion product records across multiple brands, including:
- Product name and category
- Brand
- Price
- Rating
- Color and size
- Product identifiers used as proxies for sales count

## 🛠 Methodology
- Explored the dataset structure and unique categorical values
- Aggregated pricing data to compare average prices across products and brands
- Analyzed consumer preference using product ratings and sales frequency
- Performed drill-down analysis by product type, color, size, and demographic segment
- Conducted brand-level comparisons to assess competitive positioning

## 📈 Key Insights
- H&M records the highest average prices for dresses, sweaters, and jeans, indicating a premium positioning for these product categories.
- Zara’s t-shirts are priced higher than competitors, while its sweaters and shoes are among the lowest-priced, suggesting a mixed pricing strategy across product lines.
- Adidas shoes emerge as the most expensive footwear option among the analyzed brands, reflecting a strong premium positioning in this category.
- Nike dominates sales volume for dresses, t-shirts, and jeans, while Zara leads in shoe sales and H&M performs strongest in sweater sales.
- Segment-based pricing analysis shows Zara leading in kids’ fashion pricing, H&M and Nike leading in men’s fashion, and Nike alongside Gucci leading in women’s fashion.

## 💡 Business Relevance
This analysis supports:
- Competitive brand and product positioning
- Pricing strategy evaluation
- Product assortment and inventory planning
- Market segmentation and consumer preference analysis

## 📝 Project Note
This project represents my early work in SQL-based data analysis. Since completing it, I have developed stronger skills in query optimization, comparative analysis, and analytical storytelling, and plan to revisit this analysis with more advanced SQL techniques.
